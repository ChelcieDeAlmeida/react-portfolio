             <p>Welcome and thank you for visiting my site. I'm a Sr. Business Intelligence 
                 Analyst with vast experience in a multitude of analytical tools currently working for Access Hope. 
                 I'm most comfortable with backend tools but with ambition, and a stellar work ethic, 
                 I plan to combine my passion for art and software engineering into what I hope will turn into
                 a lifelong journey of discovery and experimentation.
